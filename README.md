# Untitled-Fitness-Game
Fitness game for mobile devices. Like the Chao garden from Sonic Adventure 2, you have a little avatar, or "pet". 
Unlike Sonic Adventure 2, you increase it's stats by going to the gym; whereas in the Sonic game, you increase stats by
giving your Chao animals and boosts found in the story mode missions. You can then take your avatar and battle against 
friends in various challenges (i.e. Race, and Battle in Sonic Adventure 2). The goal is to have friends play against each other 
and motivate one another by seeing where they can improve. Due to hardware limitations, the project is now using Unity3D. 
Scripted in C#.
